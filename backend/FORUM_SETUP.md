## Next Steps

### 1. Test the Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Frontend Integration

You'll need to create API service files in the frontend:

- `frontend/src/services/forumService.js` - Post API calls
- `frontend/src/services/commentService.js` - Comment API calls

### 3. Update CreatePostPage

Connect the form to actually call the POST /api/posts endpoint

### 4. Create Additional Pages

- Post detail page (view single post with comments)
- User profile page (view user's posts)
- Edit post page

### 5. Optional Enhancements

- Search functionality
- Post tags/hashtags
- User reputation system
- Report/moderation system
- Email notifications
- Rich text editor integration

## Database Indexes

All models include indexes for optimal query performance:

- Posts: category + createdAt, author
- Comments: post + createdAt, author, parentComment
