        heading: "High and Low Tides",
        text: "Cape Town experiences two high tides and two low tides each day, approximately 6 hours apart. High tide is when the water reaches its highest point on the beach, while low tide is when it recedes to its lowest point.",

        heading: "Best Times to Visit",
        text: "For swimming and sunbathing, high tide is often preferred as there's more water and beach access. For exploring rock pools and marine life, low tide reveals hidden treasures along the shoreline.",
