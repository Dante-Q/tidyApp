## Known Limitations

1. **Category filtering** - Link exists but needs implementation
2. **Comment editing** - Edit button shown but needs implementation
3. **Like animations** - Basic toggle, could add animations
4. **Image uploads** - Text-only posts currently
5. **User avatars** - Using initials, no image uploads yet

## Architecture Notes

### State Management

- React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext)
- UserContext for authentication
- Local state for component data
- No global state library needed yet

### Data Flow

- Components fetch data on mount
- Services handle API calls
- Error boundaries at component level
- Loading states per component

### Styling

- CSS modules approach
- Consistent color scheme (blue gradient)
- Reusable patterns (cards, buttons, avatars)
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Performance Considerations

- Lazy load comments on demand
- Paginate posts list (backend ready)
- Cache category stats
- Debounce search inputs (when implemented)
- Optimize images (when implemented)
